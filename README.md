# SRAM-PROJECT
This repository contains design and verification of a low-power high-speed CMOS SRAM cell. The project showcases the full VLSI flow including schematic entry, layout generation, simulation analysis, and timing validation. Designed using 0.25Î¼m CMOS technology in Microwind and DSCH tools, the project verifies function,optimized switching and memory.
