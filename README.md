# Low Power High Speed CMOS SRAM Design

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and simulation of a low power high speed CMOS SRAM Static Random Access Memory cell. It uses CMOS technology to achieve a balance between speed power consumption and area. The design includes both schematic simulation and layout verification using standard VLSI tools.

## Tools Used

- Microwind DSCH and Layout Editor
- SPICE or Analog Simulation
- Technology 0.25 micrometer CMOS

## Design Details

### Features

- Low power dissipation during read and write operations
- High speed switching response
- Verified using analog simulation waveform outputs
- Layout verified with stick diagram and DRC checks

### Simulation Results

- Write Operation  
  Data equals 1, DataBar equals 0  
  When Wordline is high, the data is latched in the cell

- Read Operation  
  After writing, during wordline activation, out1 and out2 reflect stored values

- Waveforms confirm correct SRAM behavior and fast transition at output nodes

### Screenshots
